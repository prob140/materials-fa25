This truncation is at the high end of the distribution and therefore will not have a noticeable effect on the distribution of the minimum of a random sample. In fact, we will just assume that the category consists of exactly 7 people, as this too won't have much affect on the distribution of the sample minimum.\n",

    "## Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "You now know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to find distributions of random variables by listing all the elements of the outcome space.\n",
    "- Finding distributions by complete enumeration is not feasible for large outcome spaces, as in situations where the population and sample sizes are large.\n",
    "- When you count outcomes that satisfy a specified condition, every outcome that satisfies the condition must be counted exactly once. You have to be careful about over-counting and under-counting. \n",
    "- To find the distribution of a discrete random variable $X$, it might be complicated to find the chance of all the outcomes that satisfy the condition $\\{X = x\\}$. For a sample minimum $M$, it is much easier to identify the outcomes that satisfy $\\{M > x\\}$ and hence find the right tail probability $P(M > x)$ for each $x$. You can then combine those probabilities appropriately to find $P(M = x)$.\n",
