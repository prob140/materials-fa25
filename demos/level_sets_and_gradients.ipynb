    "Remind students how to interpret a contour plot by showing the surface in 3D, colored by height, with contours on the actual surface (a contour3 style plot) that they can rotate and manipulate (plotly style figure).\n",
    "It would help to be able to toggle on and off a slider which raises and lowers a semi-transparent horizontal plane, that intersects the surface, with the contour at the intersection highlighted. \n",
    "Then, rotate to a bird's eye view, leaving a contour + heatmap plot. Instruct to toggle on and off the heatmap to get used to the contour alone.\n",

    "Zoom in to a small segment of the surface (3D view) and add the tangent lines associated with perturbations in one coordinate at a time. Here I would:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let student select an individual coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "When they do, make the surface close to transparent, but add a cross-section showing how the function varies when the selected coordinate varies, leaving the other coordinate fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotate to a side-view so we plot the height of the surface as a function of the varying parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the tangent line through the point, emphasizing the relationship between the partial derivative at that point and the slope of the tangent\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat for the other coordinate and combine the plots (mostly transparent surface and contours, two cross-sections of the surface in bold each associated with varying one coordinate away from the point with tangent lines that toggle on and off.\n",
    "Turn on both tangent lines and fill in to get a patch of the tangent plane where it intersects the surface. I would add grid lines on it running parallel to each of the coordinate directions, with slopes matching the slopes of the partial derivatives.\n",
    "Show that, the height of the linearization at a perturbation away from the intersection point is given by the tip-to-tail sum of line segments in the tangent plane, with projection down to the tip-to-tail sum in the original coordinates. \n",
    "Relate to an inner product against the vector of partial derivatives. Name it the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the gradient vector, and linearization along the gradient, to both the surface and onto the coordinate plane below.\n",
    "Add the contours back in to show that the gradient is perpendicular to the contour passing through the point we linearized about\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop the plane, but leave the gradient vector on the coordinate plane below the surface, and its linearization on the original surface. Now, fill in the gradient vector field everywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "Allow the student to rotate the surface for a birds-eye view showing that the gradients are perpendicular to the contours everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "Toggle on and off a cursor which can be dragged around the surface. As you move on the surface, highlight the contour passing through the point, the gradient vector, and (if toggled on) a patch of the tangent plane. \n",
